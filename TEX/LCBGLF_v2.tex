\begin{abstract}
Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies are a class of compact star forming galaxies that are common at z=1 and rare in the local universe. Their drop in number density roughly follows the drop in star formation rate density from z=1. We present a study of the evolution of the luminosity function of these rapidly evolving galaxies between z=1 and z=0 using a reanalysis of COSMOS photometry and spectrscopic redshift information generated by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly team. We find that M$^{*}$ decreases by $\sim$0.7 mag, $\phi^{*}$ decreases by a factor of 6, and the number density of LCBGs decreases by a factor of 11.5 from z=1. We find that LCBGs make up 28.2\% of galaxies brighter than M$_{B}$=-15 at z=0.9 and only 1.8\% at z=0.1.

\section{Introduction}

Early Hubble deep field observations identified a class of compact, bright, star forming galaxies. \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W} showed the number density of these objects out to z=0.045 is roughly an order of magnitude lower than their number density at z=0.85 \citep{1997ApJ...489..543P} making them one of the most rapidly evolving galaxy types in the universe \citep{2007A&A...469..483R}.Thei evolution correlates with the drop in the star formation rate density of the universe from z=1 to present day. Study of the nature and evolution of LCBGs is therefore imperative to reaching a deeper understanding of galaxy evolution as a whole. 

Literature describes three classes of galaxies; compact narrow emission line galaxies (CNELG, \citep{1994ApJ...427L...9K,1995ApJ...440L..49K,1996ApJ...460L...5G,1998ApJ...495L..13G}) faint blue galaxies \citep{1997ApJ...489..559G,1997ApJ...489..543P}, and blue nucleated galaxies \citep{1995ApJ...451L...1S,1996ApJ...464...79S}, that have similar star formation rates, sizes and colors. These similar galaxy were therefore coalesced into one class and labeled Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs). The photometric criteria that define LCBGs; M$_{B}<-18.5$, B-V$<$0.6, and SB$_{e}$(B)$<21$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ \citep{2004ApJ...615..689G}, include most galaxies in the original three samples, and allows for studies that target sources with the same selection criteria at all redshifts.

It is also important to note that other galaxy types that are closely related to, or overlap with LCBGs in luminosity, color and surface brightness, have been described in previous literature. \citet{2009MNRAS.399.1191C} showed Green Pea galaxies, detected by the Galaxy Zoo project, overlap with LCBGs in blue luminosity, morphology, stellar mass, and metallicity. Higher mass LCBGs also overlap with Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies (UVLGs), which were identified by \citet{2005ApJ...619L..35H} as being local counterparts to Lyman Break Galaxies. \citet{2003ApJ...586L..45G} and \citet{2004AJ....128.1541H} have both suggested that LCBGs could be low mass lower redshift counterparts to the high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies. \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P} and \citet{1997ApJ...489..559G} noted that $\sim$40\% of their sample resemble HII galaxies, local, vigorously star forming galaxies. Finally, we note that LCBGs are distinct from Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs). LCBGs are more massive \citep{1997ApJ...489..559G,2004ApJ...615..689G,2010ApJ...708.1076T}, luminous \citep{2004ApJ...615..689G}, and have higher metallicity \citep{2010ApJ...708.1076T} than Blue Compact Dwarfs

Intermediate redshift (z>0.5) studies have looked at LCBG morphology \citep{2006ApJ...640L.143N} and spectral properties \citep{2010ApJ...708.1076T}, environment \citep{2006ApJ...636L..13C,2014ApJ...786...30C,2016ApJ...817...87C,2017arXiv170604534R}, and  Number density \citep{1997ApJ...489..559G,1997ApJ...489..543P}. \citet{2006ApJ...640L.143N} found 90\% of LCBGs with r$_{e}$<3.5 kpc are compact galaxies that will likely evolve into small disk, irregular or low-mass spheroidal galaxies. LCBGs make up about 50\% of the Butcher-Oemler population in galaxy clusters between z=1 and z=0.55 \citep{2006ApJ...636L..13C}, and are likely on their initial descent into a cluster \citep{2014ApJ...786...30C}. There is no significant difference in size, mass, luminosity, star formation rate, or metallicity between cluster and field LCBGs \citep{2016ApJ...817...87C}. \citet{2017arXiv170604534R} found cluster LCBGs have a lower dynamical to stellar mass ratio than field LCBGs at intermediate redshift, but both populations have a statistically similar distribution. The difference in this ratio between cluster and field LCBGs is also seen in local dwarf elliptical galaxies, strengthening the argument that LCBGs passively evolve into dwarf elliptical galaxies after their current burst of star formation.  \citet{1997ApJ...489..559G} and \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P} found LCBGs are similar to local HII star forming galaxies, constitute $\sim$45\% of the star formation rate density and $\sim$20\% of the galaxy population at z=0.6, and show no evolution in specific star formation rate. \citet{2010ApJ...708.1076T} found LCBGs have a wide range of metallicities and show no correlation between size and oxygen abundance or M$_{*}$. 

Studies of local LCBGs have looked at number density \citep{2004ApJ...617.1004W}, neutral gas content \citep{2007ApJ...671..310G,2014arXiv1412.4739R}, kinematics from three-dimensional optical spectroscopy \citep{2011MNRAS.418.2350P}, and morphology and environment \citep{2015ApJ...807..134G}. They have shown that LCBGs are rare locally \citep{2004ApJ...617.1004W}, are rotationally supported \citep{2014arXiv1412.4739R, 2011MNRAS.418.2350P}, and are not exclusively generating stars in a merger scenario \citep{2014arXiv1412.4739R,2015ApJ...807..134G, 2011MNRAS.418.2350P}. \citet{2015ApJ...807..134G} finds local LCBGs fit into roughly three categories: 20\% have star formation that is likely triggered by strong interactions, 40\% are clumpy spiral galaxies whose star formation is triggered by smoothly accreted gas from tidally disrupted companions or the intracluster medium, and 40\% are non-clumpy, non-spiral field galaxies with centrally concentrated morphologies, smaller effective radii, and smaller stellar masses.

In this study we examine the evolution of LCBGs using a consistent, large sample. We generate the luminosity function, and derive the number density in redshift increments of z=0.2 between z=1 and z=0. Throughout this paper we adopt H$_{0}$=70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{M}$=0.3 and we use the Vega magnitude system. In Section \ref{obs} we describe the data set we used, and how we selected LCBGs from that sample. In Section \ref{LFE} we describe the 1/V$_{Max}$ method which we used to generate the luminosity function, and how our calculation of the Luminosity function compares to previous work. In Section \ref{sec:Frac} we discuss the results from the LCBG luminosity function and how compare them to the total galaxy population. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:Conc} we summarize our results. 



\section{Data}
\label{obs}
We use data obtained as part of the COSMOS survey with photometry rederived by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey team. COSMOS is an HST Treasury Project \citep{2007ApJS..172....1S} that used 590 orbits on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys to survey a two square degree equatorial field. The survey was originally designed to better understand the evolution of galaxies and AGN over cosmic time, and how that evolution depends on environment from groups to large scale structures, such as filaments and voids. One of the key features of the COSMOS field is it's accessibility by most astronomical facilities. This has lead to surveys being carried out across the electromagnetic spectrum from radio \citep{2017A&A...602A...1S} to x-ray \citep{2016ApJ...819...62C}. 

GAMA is a project utilizing a number of ground and space based facilities to study cosmology, and galaxy formation and evolution. Their main goal is to study structures in the universe on scales ranging from 1 kpc to 1 Mpc. This includes galaxy structure, mergers, groups, and clusters. To do this they are amazing large multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic datasets across numerous regions of the sky. They have adopted the publicly available data from the COSMOS survey as their G10 region \citep{2015MNRAS.447.1014D,2017MNRAS.464.1569A}, the GAMA region at 10 hours Right Ascension.  

\subsection{Photometric data}
\label{sec:photdata}
The photometric dataset covers the central 1 degree$^{2}$, and includes observations from UV \citep{2007ApJS..172..468Z}, Optical \citep{2007ApJS..172...99C,2007ApJS..172....9T,2015PASJ...67..104T}, and Infrared \citep{2012A&A...544A.156M,2007ApJS..172...86S,2012MNRAS.424.1614O} bands. Magnitudes were calculated using the Lambda-Adaptive Multi-Band Deblending Algorithm in R (LAMBDAR; \citet{2016MNRAS.460..765W}. LAMBDAR is a software package designed to provide matched aperture photometry over images that are neither pixel- nor PSF-matched. It is specifically produced to provide consistent photometry and uncertainty to calculate the spectral energy distribution of objects in large, multi-instrument, multi-wavelength surveys such as GAMA, or COSMOS. We use the CFHT u$^{*}$ and Subaru B$_{j}$, V$_{J}$, r$^{+}$, i$^{+}$, z$^{+}$ photometry for our derivations. 

Our photometric sample includes galaxies with 15$\leq$i$^{+}\leq$22.5, roughly matching the target catalog for zCOSMOS, 15$\leq$I$_{F814W}\leq$22.5. This is the photometric completeness limit for \citet{2007ApJS..172...99C} from which zCOSMOS targets were chosen. Since most spectroscopic data comes from zCOSMOS, using their photometry eliminates the need for photometric completeness corrections, and maximizes the number of objects with available spectroscopic information. We exclude stars and Broad Line AGN using the master Star-Galaxy classification from \citet{2017MNRAS.464.1569A}.  We also derived photometric offsets between the G10 reduction and the templates from version 4.3 of Michael Blanton's k-correction code \citep{2007AJ....133..734B}, which we used to calculate our absolute magnitudes and select our source list of LCBGs. These offsets are listed in table \ref{tab:tab4}.

\end{deluxetable*}

\subsection{Spectroscopic Data}
We used a compilation of spectroscopic redshifts gathered and reanalyzed by the GAMA team. The catalog uses redshift information from GAMA's AUTOZ \citep{2014MNRAS.441.2440B}, zCOSMOS-bright 20k \citep{2009ApJS..184..218L}, PRIsm MUlti-object Survey \citep{2011ApJ...741....8C,2013ApJ...767..118C}, VIMOS VLT Deep Survey \citep{2008A&A...486..683G}, Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep{2014ApJS..211...17A}, and the 30 band photometric redshift catalog \citep{2009ApJ...690.1236I} to determine the best-fit redshift for each object. Full details of their reanalysis can be found in \citet{2015MNRAS.447.1014D}. Objects were assigned quality flags of 1 to 4, 1 being robust, high resolution redshifts from VIMOS or SDSS and 4 being photometric redshifts. We use the robust sample from \citet{2015MNRAS.447.1014D}, which includes all objects with flags 1 \& 2.

\subsection{Sample Selection}
As stated previously, \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W} define LCBGS as galaxies with M$_{B}\leq$-18.5, $\mu_{e}(B)\leq$21, and (B-V)$_{0}\leq$0.6. This combination of parameters provides the best distinction between intermediate redshift LCBGs and irregular, elliptical and spiral galaxies. \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W} points out that LCBGs are not distinct galaxies in  the luminosity-color-surface brightness parameter space, but exist at the extreme end of the continuum of galaxies in said space. 

Absolute magnitudes were calculated using the equation:
\begin{equation}
M^{Ref}=m^{Obs}-DM(z,H_{0},\Omega_{m},\Omega_{\Lambda})-KC(z,SED)
\label{eq:equation 1}
\end{equation}
Where DM is the Distance Modulus and KC is defined as:
\begin{equation}
KC(z,SED)=(k^{ref}(z)+m^{Obs}(z)-m^{Ref}(z))^{SED}
\label{eq:equation 2}
\end{equation}
as in \citet{2005A&A...439..863I}. We integrated the C libraries from kcorrect \citep{2007AJ....133..734B} into our python code to generate the k-correction and reference magnitudes. The absolute magnitude was calculated using the observed filter closest to the rest-frame B band. This minimized the applied k-correction and the error associated with it.

Surface brightness was calculated using the absolute magnitude, with the equation:
\begin{equation}
\mu_{e}=M_{B}+2.5\times log_{10}(2\pi R_{e}^{2})+36.572
\label{eq:equation 3}
\end{equation}
where M$_{B}$ is the absolute magnitude in the B band, and R$_{e}$ is the effective (or half-light) radius from \citet{2009A&A...503..379T}. The half-light radius was converted from I$_{F814W}$ to B using Equation \ref{eq:equation4} taken from \citet{2015MNRAS.447.1014D} as:
\begin{equation}
log_{10}(R_{e,B})=0.108\times log_{10}\left(\frac{\lambda_{F814W}}{\lambda_{B}}\right)+log_{10}(R_{e,F814W})
\label{eq:equation4}
\end{equation}
This simplifies to R$_{e,B}$=1.0659$\times$R$_{F814W,e}$. 

Finally, (B-V)$_{0}$ is calculated using:
\begin{equation}
(B-V)_{0}=m_{B_{j}}-m_{V_{j}}-KC_{B}+KC_{V}
\label{eq:equation 5}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure*}

All LCBGs (teal) will fall within the shaded region of the B-band surface brightness vs color ($\mu_{e}$(B)$_{0}$ vs (B-V)$_{0}$) plot, but not all points in the shaded region are LCBGs. All values are calculated in the galaxies rest frame. The points are colored to denote whether they fall within the red cloud, green valley, or blue cloud based on their (U-B)$_{0}$ color as characterized by \citet{2006ApJ...647..853W}}
\end{figure*}

\section{Luminosity Function Estimate}
\label{LFE}
\subsection{Luminosity Function Estimator}
The luminosity function is defined as the number of galaxies per comoving volume, per magnitude bin, and is most often characterized using the \citet{1976ApJ...203..297S} parameterization. In magnitudes it is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\phi(M)dM=0.4~ln(10)~\phi^{*}~10^{0.4(M-M^{*})(\alpha+1)}exp(-10^{0.4(M^{*}-M)})dM
\label{eq:equation 6}
\end{equation}
Where $\phi^{*}$ is the characteristic number density of galaxies per unit volume per unit magnitude, M$^{*}$ is the characteristic magnitude where the luminosity function turns over from an exponential into a power law, and $\alpha$ is the characteristic slope of that power law describing the faint end of the luminosity function.
Several methods have been developed to estimate the luminosity function, including \citet{1968ApJ...151..393S,1971MNRAS.155...95L,1979ApJ...231..645T,1979ApJ...234..775T,1986MNRAS.223....1C,1988MNRAS.232..431E}

For our analysis we used the 1/V$_{Max}$ method \citep{1968ApJ...151..393S} which counts galaxies within a known volume. We followed the calculations laid out by \citet{2006ApJ...647..853W} and \citet{2005A&A...439..863I}, described below. The integral luminosity function for a given absolute magnitude is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\int_{M_{bright}}^{M_{faint}}\phi(M)dM=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{G}}\frac{\chi_{i}}{V_{max}(i)}
\label{eq:equation 7}
\end{equation}
where $\chi_{i}$ is the weighting applied to correct for completeness (discussed in Section \ref{sec:Weighting}) and V$_{max}(i)$ is the maximum comoving volume within which a galaxy i with absolute magnitude $M_{i}$ can be detected in the survey, defined as:
\begin{equation}
V_{max}(i)=\int_{\Omega}\int_{z_{min,i}}^{z_{max,i}}\frac{dV}{dz d\Omega}dz d\Omega
\label{eq:equation 8}
\end{equation}
Here, z is redshift, and $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the survey region. In a magnitude limited survey, z$_{min,i}$ and z$_{max,i}$ are defined by:
\begin{equation}
z_{min,i}=min(z_{min},z(M_{i},m_{l}))
\label{eq:equation 9}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
z_{max,i}=max(z_{max},z(M_{i},m_{u}))
\label{eq:equation 10}
\end{equation}

where z$_{min}$ and z$_{max}$ are the lower and upper limit of the redshift bin the object occupies, and z(M$_{i}$,m$_{l}$) and z(M$_{i}$,m$_{u}$) are the redshifts at which an object with absolute magnitude M$_{i}$ would no longer fall in the apparent magnitude limits of the survey. We determined the Poisson error using:m 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\phi}=\sqrt{\frac{\chi_{i}}{V_{max,}^{2}(i)}}
\label{eq:equation 11}
\end{equation}

For our calculations, we used magnitude bins of 0.5 and redshift bins of 0.2. 
\subsection{Weighting}\label{sec:Weighting}
We considered galaxies in the survey that have not been directly counted due either to photometric incompleteness or spectroscopic incompleteness. As stated in Section \ref{sec:photdata} we adopted similar photometric selection criteria to zCOSMOS, namely 15$\leq$i$^{+}\leq$22.5 to maximize the number of sources with spectroscopic redshifts. We did not adopt a photometric correction because the G10 catalog is complete to m$_{i^{+}}$=24.5 mag \citet{2017MNRAS.464.1569A}, below our selection of m$_{i^{+}}$=22.5.  

We made two corrections to compensate for spectroscopic incompleteness. We first is corrected for the photometrically identified galaxies that were not targeted in a spectroscopic survey. This weight is labeled as the Target Sample Rate, and defined as:
\begin{equation}
w_{TSR}=\frac{N^{gal}_{Phot}}{N^{gal}_{Spec}}
\label{eq:equation 12}
\end{equation}
where N$^{gal}_{Phot}$ is the number of objects observed in the photometric catalog, and N$^{gal}_{Spec}$ is the number of objects targeted in the spectroscopic survey. We must also correct for objects that were targeted in the spectroscopic survey, but whose redshifts were unable to be definitively determined. This spectroscopic sampling rate weighting is defined as:
\begin{equation}
w_{SSR}=\frac{N^{gal}_{spec}}{N^{gal}_{spec}-N^{fail}_{spec}}
\label{eq:equation 13}
\end{equation}
where N$^{gal}_{spec}$ is the number of galaxies observed spectroscopically, and N$^{fail}_{spec}$ is the number of galaxies where the redshift was indeterminable. If we define the number of galaxies with secure redshifts as N$^{sec}_{spec}$=N$^{gal}_{spec}$-N$^{fail}_{spec}$, then the total weight of each object, $\chi_{i}$, is the multiple of the two weights described above:
\begin{equation}
\chi_{i}=\frac{N^{gal}_{Phot}}{N^{gal}_{Spec}}\frac{N^{gal}_{spec}}{N^{gal}_{spec}-N^{fail}_{spec}}=\frac{N^{gal}_{Phot}}{N^{sec}_{spec}}
\label{eq:equation 14}
\end{equation}
The likelihood of obtaining a secure redshift varies with apparent magnitude, so we calculate weights in magnitude bins of 0.5. Weights range from 1.04 to 1.6, with six very bright objects having a low target sample rate and corrections above 5.5.

We compared our results with those from \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z}, who previously studied the effect of environment on the evolution of the luminosity function in COSMOS. Our value for the global luminosity function shows good agreement with theirs in each of their four cited redshift bins between 0.1$\leq$z$\leq$1. Figure \ref{fig:ZUCCALUMFUNC} shows the points from our 1/V$_{max}$ calculation, and the least squares fit in blue. We also plot the Schechter function from \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z} estimation using the STY method in black. Most fits are close, but the fit in the bin 0.75$<$z$<$1.0 is clearly different from \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z}. 

In Table \ref{tab:tab1} we show the Schechter function parameters from both studies. Most fit parameters between the two studies agree within 1-$\sigma$, but our value for the slope of the faint end of the luminosity function does vary at 0.35$\leq$z$\leq$0.55 from that of \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z} by greater than 1-$\sigma$. We also note that our fit in the redshift bin 0.75$\leq$z$\leq$1.0 is very uncertain and only the faint end slope can be said to be consistent with \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z} .

We show Schechter function parameters for both the total population and LCBGs in Table \ref{tab:tab2}. The data covers approximately the same redshift range as \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z}, and we see a similar trend in the evolution of M$^{*}$, approximately 0.4 between 0$\leq$z$\leq$1. The evolution of M$^{*}$ in the LCBG population is greater, evolving by roughly 0.7 over the same redshift range. This should be expected as both \citet{2006ApJ...647..853W} and \citet{2015ApJ...815...94B} have found stronger evolution of M$^{*}$ in blue galaxies than in the total galaxy population or in red galaxy population over the same range. This evolution is consistent with cosmic downsizing \citep{1996AJ....112..839C} of the blue population of galaxies, wherein the brighter galaxies exhaust their ability to form stars and fade, leaving smaller, less luminous blue galaxies in the local universe.
Evolution of M$^{*}$ and $\phi^{*}$ can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:EVMSTAR} and \ref{fig:EVPHISTAR}.

As discussed in Section 8.4 of \citet{2015ApJ...815...94B}, $\phi^{*}$ and M$^{*}$ evolve for most galaxy populations, but there is little agreement in how much they vary. This can be attributed to the degenerate nature of the Schechter parameters, and in particular the variance in $\phi^{*}$ and M$^{*}$ with the adopted value of $\alpha$. Measurements of the luminosity density vary much less than those of the Schechter parameters because it depends on both $\phi^{*}$ and M$^{*}$. Calculation of the luminosity density requires integrating the Schechter function. We integrated from M$_{B}$=-23.5, where we have a steep drop off in the number of sources in our catalog, to M$_{B}$=-18.5, the limiting luminosity in the LCBG selection criteria. With these limits, j becomes:
\begin{equation}
j=\phi^{*}L^{*}(\Gamma(\alpha+2,L_{M_{B}=-18.5})-\Gamma(\alpha+2,L_{M_{B}=-23.5}))
\end{equation}
where $L^{*}$ is the characteristic luminosity calculated from the characteristic magnitude, $\Gamma$ is the upper incomplete gamma function, and L$_{M_{B}=x}$ is the Luminosity calculated from the absolute magnitude limits defined above.  We have plotted luminosity density ($j_{B}$) in Figure \ref{fig:LUMDENSEV}. The evolution of $j_{B}$ for the total galaxy sample seems high compared to previous surveys, but the numbers for previous surveys are taken with varying $\alpha$, which at the highest redshift ranges is not well sampled. \citet{2009A&A...508.1217Z} finds j$_{B}$=2.97$\times10^{8}h_{70}L_{\odot}MPc^{-3}$ at z=0.875 with $\alpha$=-1.03, the constant value they assumed, and \citet{2015ApJ...815...94B} finds j$_{B}$=2.51$\times10^{8}h_{70}L_{\odot}MPc^{-3}$ at z=0.9 with $\alpha$=-1.1. Both of these values are more consistent with our value.  The luminosity density of LCBGs between z=0.01 and 0.2 is lower than that of the blue population from \citet{2015ApJ...815...94B}, likely due to the low number density of LCBGs in that redshift range. At high redshift the LCBG luminosity density is roughly consistent with the luminosity density of the blue population of galaxies, j$_{B}$=1.76$\times10^{8}h_{70}L_{\odot}MPc^{-3}$ at z=0.9, from \citet{2015ApJ...815...94B} meaning LCBGs contribute a large fraction of the luminosity of blue galaxies at that redshift. 

We find that LCBGs contribute anywhere from 14-42\% of the luminosity density of the universe between 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$1.0 and -23.5$\leq$M$_{B}\leq$-18.5. At this redshift they make up roughly 62\% of the galaxy population brighter than M$_{B}$=-18.5. Therefore we find that while LCBGs make up a larger fraction of the galaxies at z=0.9, they still don't contribute a majority of the B-band light. 

We integrate the LCBG luminosity function from M=-$\infty$ to -18.5 to estimate the evolution of LCBG number density between 0$\leq$z$\leq$1. At the highest redshift range in our sample, 0.8$\leq$z$\leq$1, the LCBG density is 8.3$\times$10$^{-3}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$ and at the lowest, 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, it is 7.2$\times$10$^{-4}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$. This is larger than an order of magnitude fall-off between 0$\leq$z$\leq$1, consistent with what was found in \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W}. We have plotted the number density of LCBGs versus redshift in Figure \ref{fig:NumDensEv} to more clearly show the evolution. This shows the consistency with \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W}, and with \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P} quite clearly. You can see that between 0.5$\leq$z$\leq$1, the number density rapidly drops by about a factor of four and then slowly decreases by about a factor of two between 0$\leq$z$\leq$0.5.

To directly compare our calculations with \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P}, we have generated the LCBG luminosity function in the redshift ranges 0.7$\leq$z$\leq$1 and 0.4$\leq$z$\leq$0.7 and used that to calculate the number density. As per \citet{2004ApJ...617.1004W}, we use the absolute magnitude cut-off from \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P}, M=$-20+5log_{10}(h_{50})$ or M=-19.27, as our luminosity cut-off at z=0.85 and the LCBG absolute magnitude cut-off of M=-18.5 at z=0.55. We find at z=0.85 the LCBG number density is 4.0$\times$10$^{-3}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$ compared to the value from \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P} of 3.3$\times$10$^{-3}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$. Our value appears higher, but this is likely do to the difficulty in constraining $\alpha$ in the most distant bin. At z=0.55 we find the LCBG number density to be 2.7$\times$10$^{-3}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$ compared to the value from \citet{1997ApJ...489..543P} of 1.8$\times$10$^{-3}h_{70}^{3}$Mpc$^{-3}$.

We can also look at LCBGs as a fraction of the total population. This is done in three ways, all plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Fracev}. Plot (a) shows all LCBGs divided by all galaxies in the G10/COSMOS region . Plot (b) shows the number density of LCBGs divided by the number density of all galaxies brighter than -18.5 calculated by integrating the luminosity function. Plot (c) shows the number density of LCBGs divided by the number density of galaxies brighter than -15. We can see the fraction of LCBGs between z=0 and z=0.2 in plot (a) and (c) match well. This makes sense, as galaxies with M$_{B}$=-15 are only detectable in the lower redshift bin of the G10 dataset. The redshift bins between z=0.2 and z=0.8 in plots (a) and (b) match well also. This is because the absolute magnitude limit in the G10 dataset is close to -18.5 in those bins.too can be explained roughly because the G10/COSMOS source catalog still contains sources around M$_{B}$=-18.5. The final redshift bin in plot (a) showing the fraction of LCBGs in the G10/COSMOS source catalog, is limited by the photometry to sources brighter than -20.5. Therefore, the fraction should not match plot (b); LCBGs as a fraction of galaxies brighter than M$_{B}$=-18.5; nor plot (c), LCBGs as a fraction of galaxies brighter than M$_{B}$=-15.

\citet{1997ApJ...489..559G} found LCBGs make up (19.3$\pm$7.4)\% of the galaxy population with I$_{F814W}$<22.5 between z=1 and z=0.4 with the median redshift of z=0.594. The fraction of LCBGs in G10/COSMOS which has an apparent magnitude limit of Subaru i$^{+}$=22.5 between z=0.4 and z=0.6 is (26.4$\pm$1)\%, within 1-$]sigma$ of the value from \citet{1997ApJ...489..559G}. We have also plotted results from \citet{2010ApJ...708.1076T} in Figure \ref{fig:Fracev}. They estimated the fraction of LCBGs to be (11.4$\pm$0.8)\% also between z=0.4 and z=1 without stating their limiting apparent magnitude. They do note that for their total sample of galaxies the limiting absolute magnitude at z=1 in the R band is -18.5. At z=0.5, roughly their median redshift, their limiting absolute magnitude becomes -16.5. We find LCBGs make up 9.2\% of galaxies brighter than M$_{B}$<-15 between 0.4$\leq$z$\leq$0.6, which is roughly consistent with the value from \citet{2010ApJ...708.1076T} at their median redshift of z=0.49.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conc}
We have used data from the G10/COSMOS survey region to trace the evolution of the LCBG population between 0$\leq$z$\leq$1. We have done this by generating the luminosity function of the total galaxy population and of LCBGs in redshift intervals of z=0.2. We have found that the LCBG population appears to evolve rapidly as previously suggested, with the number density at z=0.9 approximately an order of magnitude larger than that at z=0.1. 

We see evolution of $\sim$0.8 in M$^{*}$ and $\sim$6 in $\phi^{*}$ both increasing from z=0.1 to z=0.9. Knowing that Schechter parameters are degenerate, and in particular M$^{*}$ and $\phi^{*}$ are dependent on the value of $\alpha$, we also looked at the evolution of the less degenerate luminosity density. We find that it increases  by a factor of 12 betweeon z=0.1 and z=0.9. We also show that LCBGs contribute roughly 42\% of the luminosity density of galaxies brighter than M$_{B}$=-18.5 at z=0.9. Finally, we can see that LCBGs make up a significant fraction of all galaxies at z=0.9. They make up approximately 30\% of the galaxy population brighter than M$_{B}$=-15 and 60\% of the galaxy population brighter than M$_{B}$=-18.5. In the same vein, we see that they make up less than 2\% of galaxies in the nearby universe. The rapid change in number density and luminosity density are both consistent with LCBGs being the most rapidly evolving galaxy population between 0$\leq$z$\leq$1.
